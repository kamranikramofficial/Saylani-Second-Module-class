    <!-- Arrays
    Arrays is a way of store more data in a single variable. It is a collection of data of the same data type. It is
    used to store multiple values in a single variable.
    example: var cities = ["Atlanta", "Baltimore", "Chicago", "Denver", "Los Angeles", "Seattle"];
    this is start of zero based index. So Atlanta is at index 0, Baltimore is at index 1, Chicago is at index 2, Denver
    is at index 3, Los Angeles is at index 4, Seattle is at index 5. 
    rule 
    The first item always has an index of 0, not 1. This means that if the last item in the list
    has an index of 9, there are 10 items in the list.
    The same naming rules you learned for ordinary variables apply. Only letters, numbers, $
    and _ are legal. The first character can't be a number. No spaces.
    Coders often prefer to make array names plural—cities instead of city, for example—
    since an array is a list of things.
    Like an ordinary variable, you declare an array only once. If you assign new values to an
    array that has already been declared, you drop the var. -->






    <!-- pop
    array.pop
    pop remove tha last one item from the array.
    Now the array has 7 elements: "dog", "cat", "bird", "lizard", "fish", "gerbil", and "snake".
    If you assign a new value to an array element that already has one, the old value is
    replaced by the new one.
    Using the keyword, pop, you can remove the last element of an array.
    Suppose you have an array, pets, whose elements are "dog", "cat", and "bird". The
    following code deletes the last element, "bird", leaving a two-element array.
    54
    pets.pop();
    example:
    let pope = ["karachi", "panjab", "multan", "lahore"];
    pope.pop();
    console.log(pope)
    than remove one lahore and print 3 element array. 
    example:
    let pope = ["karachi", "panjab", "multan", "lahore"];
    pope.pop();
    pope.pop();
    console.log(pope)
    than remove last 2 & multan lahore and print 3 element array.

    <!-- push
 you can add one or more elements to the end of an array.usin tis mathord 
 Using the keyword, push, you can add one or more elements to the end of an array.
 Suppose you have that same array consisting of "dog", "cat", and "bird". The following
 code adds two new elements to the end of the array.
 example
 let pets = ["dog", "cat", "bird"];
 pets.push("fish", "gerbil");
 console.log(pets)
  -->




    <!-- shift
    you can remove the first element of an array. using this mathord.this is same of pop but it remove first element not
    last element.
    Using the keyword, shift, you can remove the first element of an array.
    Suppose you have an array, pets, whose elements are "dog", "cat", and "
    example:
    let shis = ["karachi", "panjab", "multan", "lahore"];
    shis.shift();
    shis.shift();
    console.log(shis) -->







    <!-- 
    unshift
    you can add one or more elements to the beginning of an array. using this mathord. this is same of push but it add
    element but push add last add unshiht add first element.
    example:
    let pets1 =["dog", "cat", "bird"];
    pets1.unshift("fish", "gerbil");
    console.log(pets1) -->
