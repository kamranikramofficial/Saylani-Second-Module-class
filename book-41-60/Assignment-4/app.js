// Chapter-44: Commenting

// JAVASCRIPT COMMENTS

// JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
// JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
// console.log(10 + 20)
// console.log(5 + 7)

// SINGLE LINE COMMENTS (keyboard shortcut: ctrl+/)

// Single line comments start with //.
// Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

// EXAMPLE
// var animals = []; // Declare an empty array

// MULTI LINE COMMENTS

// Multi - line comments start with /* and end with */.
// Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

// EXAMPLE
/* The following function named add
    is a function that adds two numbers and
    returns the result.
*/
// function add(a, b) {
//     return a + b;
// }

// USING COMMENTS TO PREVENT EXECUTION
// Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.
// Adding // in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.
